# Curvetopia: Mastering the Art of 2D Curves

## Overview
Curvetopia is a project dedicated to identifying, regularizing, and beautifying curves in 2D Euclidean space. By converting polylines into smooth cubic Bézier curves, the solution brings order and symmetry to line art and hand-drawn shapes, offering an end-to-end process for curve regularization, symmetry detection, and completion.

## Features
- **Curve Regularization**: Identify and smooth straight lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, and regular polygons from polyline inputs.
- **Symmetry Exploration**: Detect and enhance symmetry in closed shapes, using reflection and other symmetry techniques.
- **Curve Completion**: Complete incomplete 2D curves that have gaps or have been occluded, ensuring smooth and natural shapes.

## Getting Started

### Usage
- Input Data: Prepare your polyline data in CSV format as described in the examples folder.
- Regularization: Use the provided scripts to identify and regularize shapes.
- Symmetry Detection: Run symmetry detection algorithms on closed shapes.
- Curve Completion: Apply completion algorithms to fill gaps in 2D curves.
