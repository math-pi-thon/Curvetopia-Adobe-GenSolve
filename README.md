# Curvetopia: Mastering the Art of 2D Curves

## Overview
Curvetopia is a project dedicated to identifying, regularizing, and beautifying curves in 2D Euclidean space. By converting polylines into smooth cubic BÃ©zier curves, the solution brings order and symmetry to line art and hand-drawn shapes, offering an end-to-end process for curve regularization, symmetry detection, and completion.

## Features
- **Curve Regularization**: Identify and smooth straight lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, and regular polygons from polyline inputs.
- **Symmetry Exploration**: Detect and enhance symmetry in closed shapes, using reflection and other symmetry techniques.
- **Curve Completion**: Complete incomplete 2D curves that have gaps or have been occluded, ensuring smooth and natural shapes.

## Getting Started

### Usage
- Input Data: Prepare your polyline data in CSV format as described in the examples folder.
- Regularization: Use the provided scripts to identify and regularize shapes.
- Symmetry Detection: Run symmetry detection algorithms on closed shapes.
- Curve Completion: Apply completion algorithms to fill gaps in 2D curves.
